# CookieMute Privacy Policy

**Effective date: 2026-11-01**

CookieMute is a browser extension that automatically rejects cookie consent banners. It is designed to work entirely on your device.

## Summary

- CookieMute does **not** store, transmit, sell, or share any user data.
- Page content is read locally in memory only to find cookie banners, then discarded.
- CookieMute makes **no network requests**.
- There are no analytics, ads, trackers, or remote configuration.

## What the extension processes

To find a cookie consent banner, the content script reads the page's DOM in memory: element text, attributes, and layout. This happens locally on the page you are viewing. Page content is never recorded, stored, transmitted, sold, or shared.

This local processing of website content is necessary for CookieMute's single purpose: detecting and dismissing cookie consent banners.

## Limited Use

CookieMute's use of website content is limited to detecting and dismissing cookie banners, which is the extension's single purpose. CookieMute does not sell or transfer this data, does not use it for advertising, and does not use it to determine creditworthiness or eligibility for lending.

## What is stored on your device

The extension stores the following settings in `chrome.storage.local`:

- whether automatic rejection is enabled;
- whether the optional hide fallback is enabled;
- the list of whitelisted site hostnames you added;
- a local count of banners handled.

This data stays in your browser profile. It is not synchronized to a server. Removing the extension deletes it.

## Permissions

- **storage** — save the settings listed above locally.
- **activeTab** — let the toolbar popup identify the current site for the whitelist and send a one-time reject request when you click the extension.
- **Content script on all sites** — cookie banners can appear on any website, so the script must run on the page you are viewing to detect and dismiss them.

## Third parties

CookieMute has no third-party services, SDKs, or data sharing.
